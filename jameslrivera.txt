My favorite code quote is, "<span id="k">The world is yours!</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf --><br>
<p>I am pursing my bachelors degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mandarin Chinese at the University of Georgia.  I am interested particularly blockchain security, OPSEC, and dark web monitoring.
In my free time I love to compete in ethical hacking and cyber security competitions like NCL, NCAE, and Hack The Box.   </p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing some projects im working on check out my github: <a href="https://github.com/jameslrivera">Github</a>.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>In my free time I love to play chess, piano and read. The current book Im reading is "Call Sign Chaos" by General Jim Mattis. I try to stay activate by lifting weights, and running with the UGA Cross country Club. I challenge my self by teaching my self to sew and design clothes.You can check out my work on my fashion Instagram, "String Theory," where I showcase my designs.
 Music is another passion of mine, especially jazz. I've learned to play jazz piano and even founded the UGA Jazz Club with friends who share my enthusiasm.
In the future, I dream of merging my love for computers with my passions for piano and fashion design. It's all about finding that sweet spot where technology meets art, and I'm on a quest to make that happen.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
